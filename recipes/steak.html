    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. Youâ€™ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak - seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 New York strip steaks</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Rosemary sprigs</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> - Use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter</li>
        <li><strong>Season generously</strong> - just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the pan</strong> on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 tbsp oil reduces splatter</li>
        <li><strong>Sear steaks</strong> - add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li><strong>Add butter and aromatics</strong> - melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
        <li><strong>Remove steak</strong> and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
